'''
Step 1: Iterate Through Each Sentence in the Knowledge Base
First, go through each sentence in the AIâ€™s knowledge base (self.knowledge).
Step 2: Identify Cells that are Definitely Mines or Safe
For each sentence:
If the number of unknown cells in a sentence is equal to the count of mines in that sentence, all those unknown cells are mines.
If the count of mines in a sentence is zero, then all the unknown cells in that sentence are safe.
Step 3: Mark the Identified Cells Appropriately
Mark the cells identified as mines by adding them to self.mines.
Mark the cells identified as safe by adding them to self.safes.
Make sure to also update the Sentence objects in the knowledge base when a cell is identified as a mine or safe.
Step 4: Clean Up the Knowledge Base
After marking cells, you may want to update the sentences in the knowledge base. For example, if a cell has been marked as a mine or safe, it can be removed from the sentences.
Shall we start with Step 1?
